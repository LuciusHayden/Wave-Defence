# **Wave Defence (kinda) Game**

# Author 
Hello, my name is Lucius, this is the last and largest project I made using the pygame library for Python, These few projets using pygame were very valuable in my opinion
in learning Python and getting better at programming as a whole. If you want to check out some of the projects that ive made you can check out my youtube channel or the rest of my github

- # Features

Its quite a simple game, similar to some mobile games such as survivor.io, you just have to defend against swarms of enemies that progressively get stronger. While the mobs get stronger, its also possible for the player to get stronger to fight against the mobs

- "Auras" which are buffs to damage and health which are obtained by rolling for them using points

- Points are gained from killing mobs, stronger mobs give more points

- Over time mobs get stronger (do more damage and have more health)

- Difficulty selector at the beginning (easy, medium, hard)

- A timer

- Lives/health (effected by difficulty)

- I frames (Invincibility Frames) after taking damage or losing a life

# Lessons Learned

This project helped me learn about the pygame module, game design, Python as a whole, debugging, as well as programming principals as a whole. These skills are quite useful for future projects.
